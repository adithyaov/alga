Major time consuming tests (anything that takes > 10% of total time):
testBipartiteAdjacencyMap A.G.T.Bipartite.AdjacencyMap     23.4 22.1
testLabel                 A.G.T.Label                      33.7 12.5
testSymmetricRelation     A.G.T.Relation.SymmetricRelation 11.6 16.9

testBipartiteAdjacencyMap.connect ~ Lot of time
testLabel.powerSet ~ Lot of time

Results of profiling:

2 modules take up time more than expected.
Test.Bipartite.AdjacencyMap (connect) and Test.Label (PowerSet)
There are 2 ways in which we can make the test suit faster.
1. Optimize the functions. (Can be done in the future? This might be difficult as it depends on Data.Map)
2. Simplify the test arguments. This would require us to work with QuickCheck which is a more viable and a simpler option. Basically we need to simplify the auto generated args.

I'll look into this. I will hopefully solve this in the next couple of days.
I'll simplify tests for Test.Label in PR#232 itself.
I'll create another PR for simplifying tests of Tests.Bipartite.AdjacencyMap

Test.Relation.SymmetricRelation also has a considerable amount (~11% to total runtime) of delay but it can be ignored for now.
This is more or less a global problem. I'll create an issue regarding this, which can be solved later.
